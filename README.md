## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://mac-cdn.softpedia.com/screenshots/PyCharm-Community_43.jpg)

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

It can be used to build apps, website, automation and much more. It is a userfrindly script which can be used by any one around the world üåè. The main use of python is been used for AI, Machine Learning, Automation, etc. which help us to do our work easliy.

## Built With

We will be needing few software which will help you to build script and also your program.

## Getting Started

What we will be needing few software to getting started with:

1. [Python 3.xx.x]([Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) (for Windows, Mac or Linux)

2. [Pycharm]([Download PyCharm: Python IDE for Professional Developers by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)) (select Communcation verion for Windows, Mac or Linux)

# Variable are used to store data. Variables may be of different type such as string, float, integer etc.
# Variables are also used to as input from users, and then you can store in its memory.
# Say for example if you want to save someone's age then you have to just use variable to save e.g. age = 25
# After using the variable you can use it in the print statement to print age.

age = 25  # just writing 25 means that it's your integer
print(age)  # you will get answer '25' in the terminal box but if you add quote to age then it will print age

degree = 15.5
print(degree)  # you will get 15.5 which is your float number so as a result you will 15.5

# You can use quotation marks to print string characters so that you can display.
name = 'HelloWorld'
print(name)  # you will answer 'HelloWorld' in the terminal box.

# Try yourself
number = 0 # change 0 to any number
characters = 'Change_me'
print(number)
print(characters)

# Now say for example I used 2 time the same variable with different variables. Let's check it out.
python = 22
python = 'I win.'
print(python)  # run the program and try it by yourself and check the answer.

# In some cases you need to define variable as a large name so for that you have to use underscore instead of spaces
two_words = 'First Second'  # as you can see that I have writen 2 words as a variable but in between there is no
# space I have use underscore so that it can understand as a single variable
print(two_words)

# Now we will be using boolean in python but remember one thing that python is a case-sensitive langauge so make sure
# that you write in a proper formate
is_true = True
print(is_true)
is_false = False
print(is_false)
# as you can see that I have use true or false as a boolean, but it's a case-sensitive, so you have to capitalize all
# the characters which has been needed if not that it will prompt with you error you can try it by yourself by
# changing True or False in above code

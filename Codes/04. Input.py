# Sometimes we use to get input from users to make sure that it has been matches with our program.
# This Input helps us to
# gain proper input to run our programs. Best example is youtube-dl which is based on python

# input() This will prompt a dialog box or line on terminal which will ask for input from user so that it can fulfill its needs
# you can write whatever you want into the input function to give hint to user so that the user give proper input.
# This input as your keyboard and mouse which has prebuilt keys which helps to give input.
# input('What is your name? ')  # uncomment this line to try it
# if you have just writen only input then it will save the output into memory.
# so for showing that output we will use variables to store it in and then use it out whenever we need it.

name = input("What is your name? ")  # now just run the program and then write your name.
print('Hi ' + name)  # the output of the above line will be stored in the name variable, and then it will print it out.
